# README: Creating an Advanced QR Code with Python

This Python script demonstrates how to create an advanced QR code using the qrcode library and customize its appearance using the PIL (Python Imaging Library) package. The QR code generated here contains a link to an Instagram profile but can be customized to contain any desired data.
Requirements

Before running the script, ensure that you have the following libraries installed:

    qrcode: To generate the QR code.
    PIL: To customize the appearance of the QR code and save it as an image.

You can install these libraries using pip:
 
    pip install qrcode[pil]
    
Code Explanation

Here's a breakdown of the code:

    Import Required Libraries:
        qrcode: This library allows us to generate QR codes.
        Image from PIL: We use the Image module from the Python Imaging Library to customize the appearance of the QR code and save it as an image.

    Create a QR Code:
        We create a QR code object qr with specific settings:
            version: The QR code version.
            error_correction: Error correction level (in this case, qrcode.ERROR_CORRECT_H for high error correction).
            border: The width of the white border around the QR code.
            box_size: The size of each QR code module.
        The qr object is initialized with these settings.

    Add Data to the QR Code:
        We add the desired data to the QR code using the add_data method. In this case, the QR code contains a link to an Instagram profile ("www.instagram.com/caraddict05").

    Make the QR Code Fit:
        We call make(fit=True) to ensure that the QR code is adjusted to fit the data optimally.

    Customize QR Code Appearance:
        We create an image of the QR code (img) and customize its appearance:
            fill_color: The color of the QR code modules (blue in this example).
            back_color: The background color of the QR code (black in this example).

    Save the QR Code as an Image:
        Finally, we save the QR code as an image with the filename "Advanced_QRCode.png" using the save method.

Running the Script

To run the script and generate the advanced QR code:

    Save the code to a Python file (e.g., generate_qr_code.py).

    Open a terminal or command prompt.

    Navigate to the directory where the Python script is located.

    Run the script using the following command:

    bash

    python generate_qr_code.py

    The script will create the QR code and save it as "Advanced_QRCode.png" in the same directory.

    You can then use the generated QR code for various purposes, such as sharing links or information in a visually appealing way.

Feel free to modify the script to create QR codes with different data and appearance settings as needed.
